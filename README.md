# HuffmanFileCoding

# Huffman Algorithm

* Read File to encode
* Frequency calculation
* Huffman code Generation
* Encode file to Huffman code (output Encodedstring)
* Display Symbols
* Display Frequency of Characters
* Save Encoded File
* Read Encoded File
* Decode File
* Display Decoded Output
* Display Difference between original and decoded file

**Introducing Bit Error in File**
* Introduce Bit error (randomly changing bits)
* Decocde File
* Display Difference between original and decoded file
